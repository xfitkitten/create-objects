# Objectively

## Students

The Students.js file has a class written for a student object

### 1. Create 3 new students named:
  1.. James
  2. Janet
  3. Jeff
You may proide any age you'd like

### 2. Print out each of these new objects to make sure you created them properly

### 3. Jeff wants to get done with school quickly so he's going to take a full course load. Enroll Jeff in the following courses:
  1. docker01
  2. database01
  3. english02
  4. badmitnton999

To make sure you enrolled correctly, print out Jedd's clas list ONLY

### 4. James and Janet would just want to be enrolled in:
  1. english02
  2. woodshop02

### 5. Because Jeff has such a tough course load, he's doing pretty bad. Drop his grade by 40 points

### 6. The teacher for English02 only knows and teaches the queen's Englinsh. Everyone decides to drop from the class

### 7. Jeff is still overwhelmed and also decides to drop his database class

### 8. With a smaller workload, Jeffs grades improve by 25%

### 9. Janet is so good at woodshop, in extra credit added to her overall grade

### 10. We need another method that gives displays the following information for each user
    <Name> is a <age> year old student who is currently enrolled in <number of classes> classes and currently has a grade of <grade>

### 11. Call the method you just created for James, Janet and Jeff
